# So Pekocko

Sixth project of the new web developer course at Openclassrooms. 

**So-Pekocko** wants to develop an app for evaluating its hot sauces, called "**Piquante**". 

The goal is to create an API with **NodeJS**, **Express** and **MongoDB** that will deliver all the functionalities to the frontend already in place.

I am aware that some critical data like the URI of the database are present in the repository. This is imposed by the training establishment for the validation of the project by the jury.

## Installation

**For both folders, the npm dependencies must be installed in order to start their server.**

1. In the frontend folder

        npm install
        npm start
        
2. In the backend folder

        npm install
        npm start
        
**And it's done!**
